## Weekly Updates

# Aut/7 - The first week

This week was all about team building as it was the first time, 
we had been together as a group. We met up outside of the designated 
practical to setup Git and Github collectively and setup over repos 
under an organisation.

Main goals achieved includes:
* Understanding requirements collectively.

# Aut/8 - Start planning!

This week was about thinking how to go forward as a team. 
When we arrived at our ENG practical, we brainstormed a gantt chart
on paper and decided what tasks we could all be interested in
doing. The main things that we decided we could be working on include:

* Risk Management
* Requirements
* Building the website

Tasks set for everyone this week include:

* Lachlan and Fawwaz - Researching how to design requirements
via the extended reading, decide on what questions to ask our
customer.
* Vivek - Get the website up and running and finish Gantt chart.
* Dengy - Explore Graphics libraries and collect Graphics pack.
* Sam and Milo - Work on the risk management deliverable via
reading, google and lectures.
