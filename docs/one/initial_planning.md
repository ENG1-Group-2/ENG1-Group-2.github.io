# Initial thoughts.

During the first practical, while trying to brainstorm our plan for the 
project, we quickly came the realisation that we do not have as much time 
as we thought. However, after coming to the conclusion, that different 
deliverables can be worked on by different people simultaneously, we were able 
to create the following gantt chart:

# Why have we done it like this?

* Having the skeleton of the website setup would allow us to easily
add updates once it has been hosted.
* Having a risk assessment from the very start will allow us 
to mitigate risks from day one which will helps things flow smoothly.
* Generating questions for the customer allows us to start thinking 
critically about the brief to help us form requirements.
* Writing up deliverables as soon as we are able to allows us to 
focus on other tasks once these are complete.
* Starting coding as soon as the requirements and architecture is decided
allows us to keep us enough time to manage as many unseen problems that 
may arise.
* Having pre-decided meeting gives the team something to work for.
* Getting feedback before creating the final prototype allows us to make
the product as suitable as it can be.
* Assigning time to the presentation is important as we want
other teams to choose our project.

# Roles in the project.

* As a team, we felt like having predefined roles was not
worth having yet as we have not really got up to the "storming"
stage of teamwork.
* However, each tasks on the gantt chart has been assigned to one or more
of the team:

* The main idea was to have components with a low mark with one
mark.
* Any heavy parts have multiple people.
* Every task will have someone overlooking it in case they 
need to take over.
* Anything high priority will usable be a deliverable.
* The reason the prototypes vary in priority is that getting 
started and finished can usually be the most difficult part.

* NB: 5 = High priority and 1 = Low priority
